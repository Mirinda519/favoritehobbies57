        <h2> Art</h2>
    <p id="para"> I love to do art. I love art because it is relaxing. It is also a very fun oppurtunity. Art is one of a kind. There are simply many ways to do art. These include oil pastels, painting, (to be more specific, acrylic painting), drawing, skeching, and even ONLINE art! I know, right? Only some people can be great artists. Such as me. Well I hope by reading this, you might be intersted to go in the car and get some paper!</p>
